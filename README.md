Pro Tips
When installing an NPM package, add a --save flag, and it will be automatically added to package.json as well. For example, npm install --save moment. 
Use async.parallel() when you need to run multiple asynchronous tasks, and then render a page, but only when all tasks are completed. For example, you might want to scrape 3 different websites for some data and render the results in a template after all 3 websites have been scraped. 
Need to find a specific object inside an Array? Use _.find function from Lodash. For example, this is how you would retrieve a Twitter token from database: var token = _.find(req.user.tokens, { kind: 'twitter' });, where 1st parameter is an array, and a 2nd parameter is an object to search for.
